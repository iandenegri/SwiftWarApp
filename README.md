# SwiftWarApp
First time working with Swift and trying out the language. Made a single view iOS app that lets the user draw two cards, compare their values and then keep tally of wins and losses. Similar to War. Just doesn't have deck logic to keep track of which player is losing their deck and doesn't do anything on a draw. Definitely can be improved to do those features.


# How to use
On an OSX machine you just need to pull the project, open it in Xcode and then you should be able to just hit CMD+R to run it in a simulation. Additionally fram the Run Menu the app can be run on an iOS device that's been set up on the machine and that has also been set up to be a developer device.
